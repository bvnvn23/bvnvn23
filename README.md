# Hi! 👋

Hi, I'm Oscar, an aspiring Web Developer and a Computer Science student with an insatiable passion for coding and building websites. 🌐💻 Currently, I'm gaining hands-on experience through an internship at a software house, where I'm diving headfirst into the wonderful chaos of front-end and back-end development. When I'm not glued to my screen, you can find me swinging swords and pretending to be a medieval knight in Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) – it's a blast! ⚔️🤺 I hope you enjoy exploring my projects, and if you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email.
